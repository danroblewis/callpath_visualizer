We are starting a project that will visualize the architecture of a source code repo. 

We are trying to capture only a few aspects of the source code:
- types (sometimes called classes)
- the inheritance tree of types
- the composition tree of types
- methods on types
- the network of method calls between types

Sometimes, we will have interfaces. This project might analyze interfaces as well, but we are more interested in analyzing implementations. We eventually want to visualize the architecture of an implementation of a project that has many inter-connected classes.
